## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Deterministic normalized configuration identity
The system SHALL return model and whole-configuration definitions as detached,
deeply readonly plain data. It SHALL provide a runtime projection containing
compiled field and block validators and a JSON admin/public projection that
contains only serializable configuration and block metadata. The public
projection SHALL provide deterministic structural and projection hashes for
every model and for the complete configuration using canonical JSON and the
portable SHA-256 contract. A model's structural hash SHALL be the hash of its
canonical structure: the model kind, key, version, fixed path or collection
route, ordered block allowlist, field definitions, and the definitions of its
allowed blocks, with the `label` and `description` display properties removed
only from the model, from each field definition, from each block definition,
and from each block field definition. Field keys, block field keys, and keys
inside default values SHALL be preserved even when they are named `label` or
`description`. Structural hashes SHALL exclude a collection's `listFields`
presentation metadata and the temporary `renamedFrom` synchronization hint;
projection hashes SHALL include the complete serializable normalized
definition, including `listFields`, except `renamedFrom`. Each runtime model
SHALL carry its detached canonical structure and, when it differs from the
structural hash, the structural hash produced by the earlier rule that removed
every `label` and `description` key at any depth. Neither value SHALL appear in
the public projection or in any hash. Equal semantic configurations SHALL
produce equal hashes regardless of object insertion order.

#### Scenario: Ignore display-only changes in structural identity
- **WHEN** two otherwise identical model definitions differ only in model,
  field, or block label and description
- **THEN** their structural hashes match and their projection hashes differ

#### Scenario: Ignore list presentation in structural identity
- **WHEN** two otherwise identical collection definitions differ only in their
  `listFields`
- **THEN** their model and complete-configuration structural hashes match and
  their projection hashes differ, so synchronization treats the change as a
  projection-only update that needs no version increase

#### Scenario: Ignore temporary rename metadata in configuration identity
- **WHEN** two otherwise identical model definitions differ only by a valid
  `renamedFrom` hint
- **THEN** their model and complete-configuration structural and projection
  hashes match while the runtime model retains the hint for synchronization

#### Scenario: Detect a structural model change
- **WHEN** otherwise identical definitions differ in kind, version, fields,
  allowed blocks, block schema version or fields, fixed path, or collection route
- **THEN** their structural hashes differ

#### Scenario: Fields named like display metadata are structural
- **WHEN** two otherwise identical model definitions differ only in a field
  whose key is `description` or `label`, or in a block field with such a key
- **THEN** their structural hashes differ and the canonical structure contains
  that field

#### Scenario: Structural hash is stable for configurations without such keys
- **WHEN** a configuration has no field, block field, or default-value key
  named `label` or `description`
- **THEN** each model's structural hash equals the hash produced by the earlier
  rule and the runtime model carries no pre-change hash

#### Scenario: Project configuration for public metadata consumption
- **WHEN** a valid configuration including registered blocks is normalized
- **THEN** the runtime projection exposes compiled validators and each model's
  canonical structure while its JSON admin/public projection round-trips
  through JSON without functions, canonical structures, or pre-change hashes

#### Scenario: Detach normalized configuration from caller inputs
- **WHEN** caller-owned model, field-map, block-definition, block-key, or
  list-field containers are modified after configuration normalization
- **THEN** the normalized definitions, projections, and hashes remain unchanged
  and cannot be mutated through their returned values
